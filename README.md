💧 Water Leakage Detection using YOLOv11 
This project detects water leakage in real-time video streams using a custom-trained YOLOv8 (YOLOv11) model. The system uses object detection to identify leakages from videos or cameras and highlights them with bounding boxes and labels.

🧠 Project Features
🚰 Detects water leakage in videos or real-time feeds
🔍 Utilizes YOLOv8 object detection and tracking
📦 Displays bounding boxes, class names, and track IDs
💻 Supports webcam and video file inputs
🎯 Lightweight and easy to use

🖼️ Example
